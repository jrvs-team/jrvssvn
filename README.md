# JRVS SVN

## Subversion tool (jrvssvn)

Subversion tool is a set of python scripts to ease usage of Subversion while developing software. Subversion has a huge advantage over git - even though it does not have full branch experience it allows user to partially load vaults. One can use it to create branches and one - to store a huge set of data close to production code and not overload others users svn clients.
Most of jrvssvn tools are designed to work via cmd/bash or IDLE. List of functionality will be extended over time.
